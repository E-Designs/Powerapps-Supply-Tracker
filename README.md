# Powerapps-Supply-Tracker
A supply tracker made using Sharepoint and Powerapps

Background

I am in charge of ordering the supplies that storeroom doesn't monitor. When I took over doing the ordering the person who did this before me was not using a list of any kind. The program that I enter my order into has this order template that is out dated and has stuff on there that the storeroom tracks, I don't care about the storeroom items. I don't have access to this template and can't be given access to update the template, that would be too easy. The other problem is that there are four places that the supplies come from storeroom, pharmacy, sterile processing, and special ordering. Staff always asks me where the supplies come from and where are the items located. 

I have been studying computer programing, but IT is obviously not going to give me VS and let me use C# or Asp.net.

A few years back I created a word document and organized the items that I tracked by location.
The benefit of the document:
1. Gave me a list to go by to make sure I didn't miss anything.
2. Gave me a place to scribble notes on (example: new items or account numbers).
3. Gave me control over the list.

Drawbacks:
1. It only helps me.
2. The document is a pain to update and keep organized.
3. If I someday get a job in IT, the person who takes over for me will not under stand my scribbles.
4. I am the only one that can see the information.

What I want the app to do:
1. Be easy to add new items.
2. Keep track of when I last checked the item.
3. Allow me to share a read only view with the department.
4. Be searchable.
5. Give a select group the power to edit the list.
